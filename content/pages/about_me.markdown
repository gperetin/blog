Title: about me
Slug: about-me

Hello, my name is Goran Peretin and this is my personal blog.

I'm a software engineer originally from Croatia, currently working for Twitter
in San Francisco. I mostly do Scala these days, but used to to a lot of
Python. I'm interested in anything software related, especially topics around
software complexity and how to develop software and teams that can evolve as
easily as possible.
I also gave some [talks][7] a while back, mostly about concurrency in Python.

I'm sucker for a good read, currently going through [SICP][8] and the [CTM
book][9]. More recently, I've been reading older papers from early days of
software engineering, from authors such as Alan Kay, Robert Barton and Niklaus
Wirth. Besides those, my favorite ones are [Out of the Tar Pit][10] and
[Patterns of Software][11].
