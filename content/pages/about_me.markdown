Title: about me
Slug: about-me

Hello, my name is Goran Peretin and this is my personal blog.

I'm a software guy originally from Croatia, currently working for Amazon in
Dublin, Ireland. I mostly do Python, but I'm interested in concurrency and
distributed systems as well as functional programming, especially Haskell and
OCaml. I also gave some [talks][7], mostly about concurrency in Python.

I'm sucker for a good read, currently going through [SICP][8] and the [CTM
book][9].

## About this blog

This blog is completely static, generated using [Pelican][1] static site
generator. Theme is [Vapor][2] made by Seth Lilly, originally for [Ghost][3]
blogging platform, but I adapted it so it can be used with Pelican, that port
is available [here][4].

Static files are served by [Nginx][5] from a dedicated server hosted at
[Hetzner][6].
